## How to play the game

The player controls the character's movement using the arrow keys. Feathers are scattered across the
 map, and stepping on them signifies the discovery of a bird. Pressing the spacebar and the 
button K drops a knowledge card and updates the bird count. The score in the top left corner 
increases by one point for each successful discovery.

During the game, enemy NPC may appear to disrupt the player's progress. 
Colliding with these obstacles will reduce the remaining time


## Ending a round and scoring

A round in Birdwatcher Game ends when the timer reaches zero. At the end of each round, your score 
and an end screen will be displayed. Your score represents the number of birdcards you have 
successfully collected during the gameplay session.
